Don't forget to print these:

the program output must also include detailed
print statements that display intermediate steps such as:
§ Population: A list of the generated flowers with their characteristics and associated fitness
§ Population after Sorting: The same population ordered by fitness values
§ Selected Flowers for Reproduction: The subset of flowers chosen as parents
§ Crossover Results: For each reproduction step, the program should print the two parent flowers (before
crossover) and the resulting child flowers (after crossover).
§ Mutation Results: The characteristics of the flowers before and after applying the mutation
§ Updated Population: The new generation of flowers after selection, crossover, and mutation are applied.
